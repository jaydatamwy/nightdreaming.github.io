  <p>The idea doesn&rsquo;t have to be big. It just has to be yours.</p>
  <p>The more talented somebody is, the less they need the props.</p>
  <p>Don&rsquo;t try to stand out from the crowd; avoid crowds altogether.</p>
  <p>The most important thing a creative person can learn professionally is where to draw the red line that separates what you are willing to do from what you are not.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2>From Saul bass</h2>
  <p>The nature of process, to one degree or another, involves failure.You have at it. It doesn't work. You keep pushing. It gets better.But it's good.It gets worse. You go at it again. then you desperately stab at it, believeing &quot;this isn't going to work.&quot; AND IT DOES !</p>
