  <p>I gained much in the book <a href="http://127.0.0.1:59862/preview/app/index.html">"Ignore Everybody: and 39 Other Keys to Creativity Hugh MacLeod"</a>.It is the book I would recommend all the creative people to read. His cards are very intersting. Appreciated that he is still creating them on his <a href="https://twitter.com/hughcards">twitter</a>!</p>
